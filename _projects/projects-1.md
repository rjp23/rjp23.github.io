I'm responsible for the development, production and evaluation of the [University of Leicester GOSAT Proxy Methane Data](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/18ef8247f52a4cb6a14013f8235cc1eb) product.
* Since the launch of the GOSAT satellite in 2009, these data have been produced by the UK National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO) as part of the ESA Greenhouse Gas Climate Change Initiative (GHG-CCI) and Copernicus Climate Change Services (C3S) projects.
* With now over a decade of observations, many scientific studies have used these data to examine methane trends and emissions.
