I lead the NCEO evaluation of the UK Earth System Model as part of the NERC Long-term Science Multi-Centre project.

## Aims​ of UKESM LTSM Project

* To develop a world-leading Earth system model (UKESM1) to contribute to 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the primary international modelling support for IPCC AR6.​
* Make UKESM1 available to the NERC research community.​
* To advance (e.g. through peer reviewed publications) the science of Earth system modelling, our understanding of the coupled Earth system and its future sensitivity to human activities.​
* To provide a comprehensive set of future Earth system projections for use by UK scientists, government departments and regulatory bodies.​
