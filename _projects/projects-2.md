Our innovative Climate Impact Explorer will be built on existing advanced Earth System Models (and their land/atmosphere/ocean components), processed using High Performance Computing infrastructure and assimilating state-of-the-art Earth Observation data to produce optimised model simulations and ultimately delivered via Machine Learning emulation to the end user through a cloud-based Interactive Data Portal.

It will enable decision makers without expert technical knowledge to generate and visualise, in real-time, decision relevant information relating to regionalised impacts of climate change. 

Innovative combination of:
* Earth Observation Data
* Physical Process-Based Model
* Climate Change Scenarios
* Data Assimilation
* AI (Machine Learning)
All with a strong focus on the real needs and requirements of our Stakeholder group.

The outputs of the demonstration system will be projected drought metrics over Africa and UK driven by CMIP6-based climate scenarios.
