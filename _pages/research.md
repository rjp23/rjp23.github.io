### Satellite Retrievals of Biomass Burning Hydrocarbons

My PhD in the EOS Group at the University of Leicester, titled [*Satellite Observations of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> in the Upper Troposphere*](https://hdl.handle.net/2381/7955), supervised by Professor John Remedios, focused on identifying organic compounds generated during biomass burning from space-based instrumentation and understanding their sources, distribution and transport within the atmosphere.

* Development of a novel technique to utilise thermal infrared emission spectra from satellite data in order to detect and analyse the distributions of biomass burning products in the upper troposphere.
* Extensive work performing optimal estimation retrievals in order to compare distributions.
* Highlights include: Successful detection of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, characterisation of Asian Monsoon anticyclone chemical isolation, identification of deep convection and uplift of gases, identifying signature of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> related to fossil fuel production
