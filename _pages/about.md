Welcome to my research page! My name's Rob Parker and I'm a scientist working on using satellite Earth Observation data to understand climate change.

I'm currently the *NCEO Leader and Research Fellow for Earth System Model and Climate-Carbon Data Evaluation* for the UK National Centre for Earth Observation ([NCEO](https://www.nceo.ac.uk/)), based at the [University of Leicester](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/physics/people/robparkers), UK.

I have over 15 yearsâ€™ experience in utilising satellite remote sensing FTS instrumentation to retrieve concentrations of atmospheric constituents and analysing them in order to further our understanding of the carbon cycle. I have expertise in utilising satellite data for evaluation of land surface and climate models and have previously held an ESA Living Planet Fellowship in this area. 

I now primarily work on the UK Earth System Modelling project as part of the UKESM Core Group and also represent UKESM on the ESA Climate Change Initiative Climate Modelling User Group (CMUG).

My PhD in the EOS Group at the University of Leicester, titled [Satellite Observations of C2H2 and C2H6 in the Upper Troposphere](https://hdl.handle.net/2381/7955), focused on identifying organic compounds generated during biomass burning from space-based instrumentation and understanding their sources, distribution and transport within the atmosphere.
