Welcome to my research page! My name's Rob Parker and I'm a scientist working on using satellite Earth Observation data to understand climate change.

I'm currently the *NCEO Leader and Research Fellow for Earth System Model and Climate-Carbon Data Evaluation* for the UK National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO), based at the University of Leicester, UK.
